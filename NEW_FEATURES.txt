This file contains a brief description of new features which have been added to Smarty 3.1

Smarty 3.1.22

    Namespace support within templates
    ==================================
    Within templates you can now use namespace specifications on:
     - Constants                like    foo\bar\FOO
     - Class names              like    foo\bar\Baz::FOO, foo\bar\Baz::$foo, foo\bar\Baz::foo()
     - PHP function names       like    foo\bar\baz()

    Security
    ========
    The Smarty_Security class has the new property $disabled_special_smarty_vars.
    It's an array which can be loaded with the $smarty special variable names like
    'template_object', 'template', 'current_dir' and others which will be disabled.
    Note: That this security checking is performed at compile time.
